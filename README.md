This repo contains my complete DSA preparation using structured topic-wise resources in Java. Inspired by curated sheets like [Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interview-roadmap/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/), it includes clean code, problem approaches, and time/space complexities.

## 🎯 Objective

- ✅ Build strong core in DSA
- 💼 Prepare for backend/software engineer interviews
- 📘 Track 300+ solved problems in one place

## 🧠 Learning Approach – Best Practices

- 📌 **One problem at a time:** Don’t rush. Understand the pattern.
- ✍️ **Write clean, commented code:** Future-you will thank present-you.
- 🧾 **Keep a daily log:** What did you learn today? Summarize briefly.
- 📂 **Organize your repo topic-wise:** Easy to review before interviews.
- 📚 **Revise weekly:** Problems fade if you don’t revisit them.
- 🧠 **Practice like it’s brain gym:** DSA trains you to *think*, not just code.
